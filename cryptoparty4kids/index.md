Cryptoparty4Kids @ Hack.lu: let’s secure the treasure as quickly as possible!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Here is the plot: help us secure the treasure before Hack.lu’s mascot gets robbed!
 
In order to prevent the robbery, we will show your child how to secure a treasure with sensors and robots. The most important: He/She will be the one programming them. 
 
The next Cryptoparty4Kids will take place on next Tuesday 18th October, 2016 from 4.30 PM to 6 PM at the Hack.lu conference dedicated to information security, which will be organized at the Alvisse Parc Hôtel, located in Luxembourg-Dommeldange.
 
The Cryptoparty4Kids event, in relation to the BEE SECURE national initiative, helps children understand information and communication technologies.
 
Since Hack.lu is an international conference, Cryptoparty4Kids will be given in English. This event is for children aged from 7 to 12 years old. No particular skills or previous experiences are required.
 
The number of seats is limited (12), register your children as soon as possible!
 
This project is co-financed by the European Commission and is taking place in the framework of  the European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM)
